    "*This notebook demonstrates using the Meraki Python SDK to restore Internet (WAN) and VPN traffic uplink preferences, as well as custom performance classes, from an Excel file. If you have hundreds of WAN/VPN uplink preferences, they can be a challenge to manipulate. This demo seeks to prove how using the Meraki API and Python SDK can substantially streamline such complex deployments.*\n",

    "If an admin has backed up his Internet and VPN traffic uplink preferences and custom performance classes, this tool will restore them to the Dashboard from the Excel file backup. This is a more advanced demo, intended for intermediate to advanced Python programmers, but has been documented thoroughly with the intention that even a determined Python beginner can understand the concepts involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an admin can use the appropriate template Excel file and update it with the appropriate info, e.g. subnets, ports, and WAN preference, then this tool can push those preferences to the Dashboard for the desired network's MX appliance. With the Meraki Dashboard API, its SDK and Python, we can restore hundreds of preferences without using the GUI.\n",

    "And we're done! Hopefully this was a useful deep dive into Python programming and interacting with the Meraki SDK and Excel workbooks. We tackled a problem that is tough to solve in the Dashboard GUI and showed how it can be done very quickly via API and the Python SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, writing this much Python to solve your own issues can be a daunting task. That is why it is always relevant to consider how often you plan to solve a given problem, and invest your time accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we used Excel workbooks, but you can imagine that there are all types of data structures that might be used instead of Excel workbooks, e.g. CSVs, plain text, YAML, XML, LibreOffice files or others, and with the right code you can use those instead of Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider whether there are any \"gotchas\" for which we didn't prepare in this code demo. For example, what if you already have the maximum number of custom performance classes defined in the Dashboard--how might that interfere with your ability to restore the backup using this code? What might you add or change to handle that possibility?\n",
